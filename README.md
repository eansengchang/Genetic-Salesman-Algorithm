## Selection Algorithms
- Truncation selection
This is the selection that takes the top % of the paths and cuts off the rest.
- Roulette Wheel Selection
This is the selection that gives weighted probablities based on a path's "fitness"
- Stochastic Universal Sampling
This is similar to roulette wheel selection but it uses a equal sampling
- tournamentSelection
This gives probabilities to each of the different paths and has everything normalized so that everything adds up to 1.
## Crossover algorithms
- Partially Mapped Crossover
- Order crossover
- Cycle crossover
